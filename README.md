Adaptive Hybrid Quantum Hashed String Search Algorithm 

# Description
This repository contains the implementation of the Adaptive Hybrid Quantum Hashed String Search Algorithm. 
The algorithm is designed to efficiently search for a specific string within a larger text using Grover's algorithm and a Quantum Counting algorithm.

In order to run the testing setup, install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file. The testing setup is designed to run on a local machine with Python 3.8 or higher.

Algorithm test can be initiated from `main.py` file using default parameters. Different settings and test cases can be performed by modifying the provided class intialization parameters.
